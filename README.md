 # zach-allen-e_commerce

 This week's challenge consisted of being given starter code and developing the back-end of an e-commerce website using Express.js and Sequelize working with MySQL. By creating route 
 javascript files, we were able to connect to a local server and enable a user to search, create, update, and delete categories, products, and IDs within the store.
